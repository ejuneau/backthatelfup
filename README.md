## What is this for?
This website sucks. It's currently only a testing ground for the bibliography component that will be found on the website.

  
## It looks like shit?
Remember that all styling can be edited later. This is just one hour of proof-of-concept work

## What is left to do?

 - [x] Host site on Render
	 - [ ] (optional) Host site on *your own* Render account
 - [x] Present website
 - [x] Grant access to GitHub (hi)
 - [ ] Discuss formatting
	 - [ ] Implement discussed changes
 - [ ] (optional) Edit DNS records


## How can I edit things?
The [categories.js](https://github.com/ejuneau/backthatelfup/blob/main/src/categories.js) file contains all the values that are intended to be edited.
The bottom of the file contains an annotated version to give a better idea of what should go where.

## How can I view this website?
Since it is currently just a proof of concept it's currently only available on Render through this link.

If you're happy with how things look later on we can talk about moving your current DNS records so backthatelfup.com points to this site instead.
